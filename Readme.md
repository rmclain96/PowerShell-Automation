- Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan McLain, this is my public Github repository that will be used for general project storage for me to pursue in my free time

- I have been using PowerShell for more than 2 years, and I am still continuing to learn, as there is always more that can be done to improve or optimize. If you see anywhere a simple improvement can be made, please let me know or feel free to make the change yourself so I learn from you!

- Many of my projects that I do for individuals or in my work contain PII or confidential information that I will not leave on a public repository. Due to this, most of the projects on here will be small projects for research purposes or general collaboration.

Largest projects that I am  working on

[AntiMalwareDownload.ps1](https://github.com/rmclain96/PowerShell-Automation/blob/main/AntiMalwareDownload.ps1)
- Downloads most up-to-date antivirus, antimalware, and system cleaning tools. By doing this, we are capable of storing an up-to-date repository of the installation EXEs


[TZTron.ps1](https://github.com/rmclain96/PowerShell-Automation/blob/main/TZTron.ps1)
- Verifies it is being launched with elevated privledges, then reaches out to https://www.bmrf.org/repos/tron/ and grabs the most recent version of Tron. Tron then runs with minimal user interface.
