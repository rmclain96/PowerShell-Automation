- Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan McLain, this is my personal Github that will be used for general project storage for me to pursue in my free time

- I have been using PowerShell for more than 2 years, and I dont think I will ever feel that I have learned everything regarding powershell, as there is always more that can be done to improve or optimize. If you see anywhere a simple improvement can be made, please let me know or feel free to make the change yourself so I learn from you!

- Many of my projects that I do for individuals or in my work contain PII or confidential information that I will not leave on a public repository. Due to this, most of the projects on here will be small projects for research purposes or general collaboration.
